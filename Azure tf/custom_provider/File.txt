As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there isn't a specific azurerm_custom_provider in the official AzureRM provider for Terraform. The official AzureRM provider is developed and maintained by Microsoft and the Terraform community, and it primarily includes resources, data sources, and configurations for interacting with Azure resources.

If you are looking for a custom provider or resource that is not included in the official AzureRM provider, you would typically create your own custom provider or resource using the general guidelines for creating custom providers in Terraform.

Here's a simplified example of how you might create a custom resource with a custom provider in Terraform:

Custom Provider:
Create a new directory for your custom provider project and implement the main provider logic in Go. This is where you would handle the CRUD operations for your custom resources.

go


// main.go
package main

import (
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/schema"
    "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/plugin"
)

func main() {
    plugin.Serve(&plugin.ServeOpts{
        ProviderFunc: func() *schema.Provider {
            return &schema.Provider{
                ResourcesMap: map[string]*schema.Resource{
                    "custom_resource": resourceCustomResource(),
                },
            }
        },
    })
}

func resourceCustomResource() *schema.Resource {
    return &schema.Resource{
        Create: resourceCreate,
        Read:   resourceRead,
        Update: resourceUpdate,
        Delete: resourceDelete,
    }
}

// Implement CRUD operations for custom resource



Terraform Configuration:
Use your custom provider and resource in your Terraform configuration.


hcl

provider "custom" {
    // Configuration for your custom provider
}

resource "custom_resource" "example" {
    // Configuration for your custom resource
}


Compile and Use:
Compile your custom provider using go build and place the binary in the same directory as your Terraform configuration. Initialize and apply your Terraform configuration.


bash

go build -o terraform-provider-custom
terraform init
terraform apply
Remember that creating a custom provider involves writing code in a programming language (usually Go), following the Terraform SDK guidelines, and implementing the necessary CRUD operations for your custom resource.
